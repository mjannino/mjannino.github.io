      <h1 class="center-it">Welcome to Blackjack!</h1>
      <p>This is a project for Software Engineering 1 by Michael Jannino.</p>
      <p>The rules are simple:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The goal is to reach 21 by either "hitting" or "staying"</li>
        <li>The game starts out with two cards, with one of the dealer's face-down</li>
        <li>Face cards count as 10</li>
        <li>Aces can count as 1 or 11</li>
        <li>You cannot exceed 21; in the event of the dealer and you exceeding 21, house wins</li>
        <li>For each hand won, you gain 10 points, and for each hand lost, you lose 10 points; in a tie, you gain 5; pocket aces for a dealer is a bust and immediate blackjack is a win (house rules)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Click the link below to try the game out; I hope you enjoy it.</p><br/>
